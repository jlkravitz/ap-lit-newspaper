# Periodical Discourses

This is a Crime and Punishment newspaper project for AP Literature and Composition.

Since I could only host static sites on github and since I didn't want to copy
and paste headers/footers on each page, I made this a single-page-app. At each
hash change, the code responds differently. Most of the html is within client-side
templates.
