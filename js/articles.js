	character: 'Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov',
	inspiration: 'My inspiration for this article came from my interest in the philosophy of Nietzche&rsquo;s &ldquo;superman.&rdquo; As we know from the Epilogue of the novel, Raskolnikov is in a Siberian prison. I thought it would be an interesting twist to have Raskolnikov writing this article from this prison. The article allowed me to explore Raskolnikov&rsquo;s personality, but, at the same time, it allowed me to change certain aspects of his character which evolved over the years since the murder.',
	body: '<p>I remember it like yesterday. I had motive; I had a weapon (it may have only been an axe, but it got the job done); and I had a plan. I killed the pawnbroker. Blood splattered everywhere, leaving a physical and mental stain that would surround me for the rest of my life&#8230;</p> <p>I just remembered the article I wrote six months before the murder I committed. I believe it was entitled &ldquo;Concerning Crime.&rdquo; I felt a deep connection with these ideas. I thought I was the &uuml;bermensch, the superman, the extraordinary man with a power to remove the obstacles that stood in my way, to follow my own moral codes. As determined as I seemed to Porfiry about the theories in my article (218), I realize now that I was wholly wrong. What I thought were my own morals were really baselessness, ignorance, helplessness. It may seem to the reader a harsh charge, but nonetheless, I feel it is true.</p> <p>Porfiry &ndash; I remember it quite well &ndash; was trying to get a confession out of me as he elaborated on the ideas in my article: &ldquo;&#8230;there are persons who are able, or rather, not who are able but who have every right, to commit any wrong or crime, and that laws, so to say, are not made for them&rdquo; (219). I believed this to be true, no doubt&#8230;Sure, there are those who can ignore all laws. But, realistically, not everyone can be like this. This person must be the right person. There cannot be so many superman &ldquo;gods,&rdquo; as Nietzsche put it. Back then, I was no extraordinary man&#8230;but&#8230;today&#8230;today is different.</p> <p>Prison has changed me. That day I thought I was killing a principle (233)&#8230;I was&#8230;it was&#8230; I killed a person&#8230;a living, breathing person&#8230;and I do regret it. I regret it as a &ldquo;simple blunder,&rdquo; though I have no guilt for what I did (458). What I did was no sin, but just an error on my part. Now I am in this Siberian prison, &ldquo;on the bank of a wide remote river&rdquo; (451). As I sit in this jailed cell, toilet crouched in a cramped corner, half-size bed laid across the ground next to the sink, and measly sums of unattractive food, I have had plenty of time to think. It is not the fact that I killed a person that bothers me&#8230;it is the fact that I killed this person believing I was the &uuml;bermensch. If I were this &ldquo;superman,&rdquo; it would have been acceptable...But I wasn&rsquo;t, so it is not. Say I were to commit the murder now &ndash; then, it may have been OK&#8230;my mind might not be warped and fixated on my crime. I, a mighty god! Think of it!</p> <p>Every Saturday, the guards let us go the library for one hour. We can read to our hearts content for that one hour, then our time is up. As I meander around the worn-down book shelves, I am attracted to the philosophy section. Nietzsche and I have strikingly similar ideas, but one thing I confidently disagree with. He says the &uuml;bermensch is just an ideal, something we can think about, but not actually see. I believe this not to be true&#8230;Frankly, I am evidence of this untruth! Razumikhin, I remember, was scared for me &ndash; scared that the detectives would think I committed a crime he thought I didn&rsquo;t commit: &ldquo;You have nothing to do with it, so be hanged to them! We shall have the laugh of them afterwards&rdquo; (249-250). He was horrified at my ideas hidden within &ldquo;Concerning Crime.&rdquo; I am sure he had little idea of what was going on in my head (as did I), but now my head is clear. I know who I am and what I want to do. I feel an obligation to murder those who worsen society, an obligation that I cannot control. Who shall die first I do not know, but it shall be done, one by one.</p> <p>Luzhin? He angers me&#8230;I never liked him. Why he would go for Dunya I do now know&#8230;and I most likely never shall. He&rsquo;s rich and only wanted to &ldquo;help&rdquo; our family, as he put it. Oh, and Svidrigaylov? Thankfully, he&rsquo;s dead. Porfiry? He was always suspicious of me, implementing creative strategies to get my confession (377). He is a smart man, that man&#8230;He may not have forced my confession, but he no doubt expedited the process.</p> <p>Only 7 more years&#8230;until I can exercise my moral codes... &ldquo;We shall see, we shall see&#8230;&rdquo; (377).</p>',

	title: 'The Fluidity of Friendship and Family: an Investigation of the Definition and Importance of Social Constructs',
	author: 'Ryan Lin',
	character: 'Dmitri Razumikhin',
	inspiration: 'Friendship and family plays a vital role in the success of Rodion. This paper aims to illustrate the purpose of such social constructs through the eyes of Razumikhin.',
	body: '<p>Throughout the history of the mankind, all persons have gone with some sort of care from friends and family. For most people, their parents took care of them; mothers and fathers nurture their children until adulthood, and after which the cycle continues with a new progeny. This unwavering cycle of life and death brings about a myriad of questions answered in the study of social constructionism. Do animals form social bonds? Yes. However, this question misses the fundamental goal of social constructionism: what roles do these social interactions play in the everyday lives of people and what effect does it have on society?</p> <p> In order to fully understand the concept of social constructionism, we must first look toward a formal definition for &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;family.&rdquo; What exactly do these words mean and how do they define being? For humans, a family is a group of persons related through blood, marriage, or house. Examining the relationship of house further, we find that friends may be considered family; a family that an individual chooses to become close with and develop personal bonds. In this respect, it is easy to then question what exactly constitutes a friend. A friend may be defined as someone a person enjoys being with; however, this would raise the question of whether the person must reciprocate such feelings. On a personal level, the clear answer is yes-it matters a great deal to an individual what the other thinks: the human condition inherently calls for a curiosity of the other. Thus we may conclude that a friend has two prerequisites: 1) a person that an individual enjoys being with and 2) reciprocate feelings, or in other words, a mutual affection between two people. </p> <p> All humans have a basic need for some family or caregiver in the beginning years of life. A baby does not emerge from the womb fully clothed and ready to take on the dangers of the earth, rather, it appears crying and defenseless, unsettled from its previously comfortable abode. However, mankind would appear to require family past the developmental stages of life. Family plays an integral role in the development of identity. Additionally, they often provide emotional growth for the individual; the family creates a base plate for the living soul (216-217) to spring from. It invigorates the mind and the body in order to help create and foster a new human experience. Family helps to define what people believe to be real and what they believe to be right: the role of family helps solidify moral values. </p> <p> Returning to the definition of friendship, what role would such a being have in the grand scheme of society? Unlike familial bonds, friendships are created and forged through time; family is handed to each and every individual whereas friends must be sought and fought for. Personal habits are undoubtedly affected by friends: socialization subconsciously implants thoughts and beliefs within the minds of people. Furthermore, the responsibilities to a friend often subjugate other desires, be it caring for a friend (166-173) versus a party, or want of riches versus maintaining a friendship. The actions taken by an individual to these choices embody the morals and values taught to them through his or her fraternization with friends and family. Consequently, social order has basic ties to the beliefs of groups of peoples: families of people. Inherent bonds to society exist in the realm of friendship; society is made of an amalgamation of people, all of whom are guaranteed to have a friend. Transitively, a society can be thought of as a large chain of friends and families that unite to form a network of individuals. These individual relationships run the world: social interaction keeps humanity moving forward.</p> <p> Ultimately, friendships and families are inextricably linked. A family of friends may constitute one&rsquo;s second family, or their only family in the case of a broken home. When considering the wide reaching implications of social constructs, we must take time to investigate their purpose and definition. To this end, the normative behaviors of society are created from the basics of humanity: the interpersonal relationships formed from friendships and family. Though some may argue of how social relationships come about, they undeniably affect society through the collective actions of characters.</p>',

	title: 'Concerning Crime',
	author: 'Ryan Lin',
	character: 'Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov',
	inspiration: 'Throughout the course of&rdquo;Crime and Punishment&rdquo;, Rodion often utilizes his paper to justify his killing of Lizaveta and Alyona. This paper attempts to recreate the ubermensch-esque style of justification along with a critical analysis behind the reason for crime.',
	body: '<p>Discount the idea that equality leads to a better world. It doesn&rsquo;t. People have and always will face different challenges in their separate, immeasurable, indigent lives. These challenges build the human race. Over the course of human history, crime has always prevailed as a never ending onslaught of broken moral code. Everyone has the capacity to commit crime. This paper investigates the root cause of crime; how, in committing crime, some men surpass the human condition, transcending into a different plane of existence, while others may simply harm themselves and others.</p> <p> A criminal must have no regard for the universality of moral law. In effect, crime transgresses the boundaries that humanity places upon its people. Crime harms everyone. Crime destroys fundamental beliefs. Society itself does not truly know what it means to commit a crime. It does know, however, that crime harms morality and oftentimes undermines the law. In effect, one can conclude that a criminal has no need for society.</p> <p> Psychologically speaking, how &ldquo;well&rdquo; is a criminal? Before the act, the perpetrator of crime might contemplate, plan the act months or weeks in advance. His psyche takes a toll. He continuously wonders how he will ever succeed in the face of the law. He might doubt himself (1-2). The ceaseless self-doubt gouges into the mind of the criminal, rendering him unresponsive to moral thought. Only the gravity of his actions matter in his mind. The criminal ponders the ramifications of his actions, thinking that he might lose everything and gain nothing, finally concluding that he will not follow through. But, in the end, he does do it. The door opens, the axe falls, and the victim dies (64-68). </p> <p> The fruition of crime engenders two distinct possibilities. On one hand, the criminal kills for the sake of killing, not for personal gain, but for the greater good. The other case uncovers a simple utilitarian exercise. In the latter case, the criminal may continue to commit crime after crime simply to gain more capital. This inevitably leads to societal harms, with laws broken every which way with no gain to society whatsoever. In essence, this crime is unjust. Moreover, crime, a psychologically taxing event, cleaves through the criminal&rsquo;s mind, leaving him a spineless, immoral being: &ldquo;the act of committing a crime is always accompanied by some morbid condition,&rdquo; (219). The psyche of an ordinary man will invariably be damaged in the commission of crime. Undoubtedly, crime committed in this manner should never reach realization. This then begets the secondary problem.</p> <p> Is crime ever justified? When a man kills for the benefit of society, does he himself surpass humanity? People are inherently unequal. Egalitarianism, conversely, deems this notion untrue. To this end, there are several assumptions that one must accept as true in order to justify &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; (225) murder. Return to my opening statement. Equality does not necessarily lead to a better life. Moreover, one must assume that morality and law has no meaning without personal meaning, and consequently, an &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; man would not &ldquo;suffer if he is conscious of error&rdquo; (224). The murders and crimes an &Uuml;bermensch commits would then be deemed by one above moral law to benefit society in some way, for example, the loss of a wretched old lady may benefit the poor masses. A lapse of moral judgment never would inflict such a theoretical superman. He is without fault. Conscious suffering and psychological harm do not come upon our &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; criminal because he fashions his own morality. He remains pure and untouched.</p> <p> Society and the government may not be accepting of the notion of justified crime. However, as with all progress, the key remains an open mind. Isaac Newton. Galileo Galilei. Their breakthroughs met heavy resistance but ultimately proved true. With the modern world changing so quickly, this paper postulates a novel idea for the betterment of humanity as a whole. I hypothesize the idea that the psychological impact of crime inflicts two different classes of man differently. Egalitarianism is wrong. A principle that all of humanity remains equal remains a revolting notion that spits in the face of individual development. Crime can be justified.</p>',

	title: 'Like A Moth Circling a Candle to Its Death',
	author: 'Sidonie Kilpatrick',
	character: 'Pofiry Petrovich',
	inspiration: 'Porify Petrovich is a hunter in the field of investigations. This detective has uncovered many murderers and thieves based on his intuition and methods for uncovering a murderer. Here he explains his philosophy for discovering a guilty suspect.',
	body: '<p>&ldquo;...Every case, every crime, for example, as soon as it really occurs, at once becomes a quite special case, and sometimes it is absolutely unlike anything that has ever happened before&rdquo; (287). I have been a detective for many years. I see what most do not see: the facial expressions, the tone in an innocent man&rsquo;s voice, and especially the tone in a guilty man&rsquo;s voice. Ever since childhood I have excelled and enjoyed pastimes that involved the alluring game of cat and mouse. As a teenager, I learned to identify people who committed minor crimes, such as stealing. I also read profusely about the perfect crime to harness and fine-tune my skills. This ultimately paved the way to my future career that is my passion and my life.</p> <p>My profession is based on evidence. If I do not have support to substantiate my belief, I cannot convict a man of his crimes. I am &ldquo;fallible like everybody else, I confess...I want to have evidence that is like two and two make four! I want something like direct and incontrovertible proof! (286). By arresting a suspect prematurely, I feel as though this is the worse thing a detective can do because they give the man piece of mind and allow himself to not be on his toes constantly, which would consequently cause him implicate himself.</p> <p>Interrogations are very important because I lead the suspect to believe that I know what they have done, but instantly calm their nerves by convincing them that I see them &ldquo;as a visitor&rdquo; (284). These tactics seem polar opposites because they switch from hot to cold, but they fluster the suspect and feel as though they have &ldquo;fallen into a trap&rdquo; (283). I believe that &ldquo;a legal method, applying to all sorts of investigations, by which they begin with trivial matters, far removed from the real subject, or even with something serious, so long as it is quite irrelevant, so as to encourage the person being interrogated, or rather to distract his attention and lull his mistrust, and then suddenly stun him by hitting him on the crown of his head with the most dangerous and fatal question&rdquo; (282-283). It is quite comical during my interrogations because I &ldquo;gesticulate ceaselessly&rdquo; and pace back and forth asking questions. For suspects that believe that they are superior to you, take this as your advantage. They will not suspect where the line of questioning is going when talking to a babbling detective and will assume that you are incapable of discovering their secret. They will soon become agitated because you will not give them a moment to think, let alone think about where you are heading in the interrogation. At this exact moment, you address exactly why they are here and ask them a specific question that either implicates them or produces a hole in their allaby.</p> <p>The poison that causes men to confess is guilt. It strips away their patients and eats away at their conscience. This affects the felonious so much so that they are like moths circling &ldquo;around me as if I were a candle: freedom will no longer be a boon to him; he will begin to brood, he will get himself into a muddle, entangle his own feet in a net, and worry himself to death!...He&rsquo;ll keep circling round me, closer and closer, and then plop! He&rsquo;ll fly straight into my mouth, and I&rsquo;ll swallow him, and that will be satisfactory&rdquo; (287-288). They cannot escape this fate. They will either confess or go mad. I even influence this during my interrogations because I make the suspect feel that I am taunting them, which ultimately enrages him, and I act afraid as though they are going crazy and they are over sensitive. This causes the suspect to become nervous because they will think that I deem them guilt, but in actuality, I have already thought that since they walked into my office.</p> <p>An interrogation is &ldquo;an art, in its own way&rdquo; (284). They take constant practice and force you to think past the normal constraints of asking simple questions that have obvious answers. They are also very satisfying once you close a case and ensure justice to a grieving family.</p>',

	inspiration: 'Without a doubt, Peter Petrovich is selfish and arrogant. His actions, seemingly charitable and generous, always benefits himself before others. However, Peter is rich, influential, and confident; exuding his confidence through his clothing and appearance.',
	body: '<p>As a prestigious lawyer, ranking as a Civil Councillor (29), a position of high political and social standing, I know everything a man should know about confidence, something most of you simple don&rsquo;t possess. During my daily carriage journey to my newly renovated office, I&rsquo;m tormented by the sight of countless men in tattered clothes. From my decades of experience in the law industry, an industry that demands self-assurance, I can conclude that confidence begins externally and works its way within. When a stranger, an employer, or a woman first lays eyes on you, what does he or she see? From a distance, their first impression is how you dress. Sub-consciously, they judge you, making assumptions about your reliability, dedication and your integrity. Thus, the first step toward achieving assurance similar to my own is through your appearance, your first impression.</p> <p>If you model yourself after me, you&rsquo;ve already made a great first impression without even saying a word. First, All clothing must be new and clean. Even if a jacket fits like a hand-made glove, a threadbare or out of style jacket will only hinder your appearance. Dispose of that insult of a jacket. Tailor your jackets, shirts, and trousers to conform and complement your body. A tailor can work wonders; drawing attention to the shoulders while narrowing the waist. Of course, my personal clothes require minimal to no alterations. Next are the essentials every respectable, confident man needs in their wardrobe. The three things every man needs are a hat, a watch, and a pair of gloves. Due to my financial stability, I prize my elegant, handmade round hat, my soft, French calfskin gloves (124) and my solid gold hunter (122). Combined, these accompaniments add a flourish while demonstrating a superior sense of sophistication and wealth. Having fitted clothes along with a few accompaniments apply year round while casting the foundation for a tasteful wardrobe.</p> <p>While some advice applies all year, there are seasonal changes. In the majestic St. Petersburg summers, I wear brighter, more vivid colors to align with summer&rsquo;s cheerful tone. For a typical day, I wear a light-brown summer jacket, brightly colored trousers and waistcoat, and solid shirt with contrasting stripe (124). With bright colors, I appear youthful, lively and energetic. </p> <p>Now that I have provided clothing advice, I shift to another important aspect: personal grooming. One of the best benefits of a fresh and handsome face (124) is that it disguises my true age. Hair is another tool to emulate youth while adding a personal flourish. Finding the right haircut takes time and trials. In my experience, mutton-chops complement my cheeks while curled hair (124) complements my face. I advise finding your own suitable style. However, clean, healthy skin is essential to completing a youthful face. </p> <p>Tasteful clothing and an organized appearance only get you past a person&rsquo;s first glance. What do you now that you will have a conversation? A conversation is unscripted and demands you to adapt. Fortunately, as a Civil Councillor and esteemed lawyer, I have copious practice responding to what others say. That being said, I do have some wisdom that applies to most conversations Now you smile, look into their eyes, and talk about what you know best, yourself. I integrate and weave the pompous and varied vocabulary only a university education can provide into everything I utter. Instead of saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;, Say &ldquo;I regret, with complete and absolute sincerity, that I find you in this state.&rdquo; ( 124) Not only do you exercise a lexicon superior to the average St. Petersburg man, thereby asserting to the other party of your superior education, you also illustrate your emotions, revealing your compassionate characteristics as well. I also disclose my accomplishments during casual conversation to bolster my superior stature. For instance, I feature my recent &ldquo;important case in the Senate&rdquo; (124) while illustrating the parties and galas I attend due to my rank as a Civil Councillor (29). In conjunction with my refined fashion sense, I allow others to deduce that I&rsquo;m the quintessential man: a winning combination of physical and intellectual countenance.</p> <p>To most men, confidence eludes their grasp. I consider myself fortunate that I deduced the magical formula to achieve total self-assurance. Early in my career, I realized that people are quick to judge others and turned that knowledge to my advantage. A sharp suit and a few elegant words are a man&rsquo;s best friend. So before you set out on your next important meeting, remember my advice. Remember what it takes to make a man.</p>',

Yes, god forgives all . . . and I am not higher than God, certainly not. Forgiveness and compassion is only what the Lord asks of you, and of me. I am the holder of a yellow card in my neighborhood of St.Petersburg, not because of my father&rsquo;s inability or my stepmother&rsquo;s wishes. No, I hold my card for my duties, my duties to my siblings, and to myself. I do not expect society to forgive me for my . . . suggestive actions in the recent past.

These people are usually the scum of the earth that sell whatever they can get their hands on to pay for their consumption that the price of their family; yet they are still giving me a profit (4-7).   The allure of moneylending lies in the fact that no one will pay their interest to get their pledges back and therefore the profit is twofold. I usually like to half the price of the the appraised value and add around ten percent depending on how threatening the customer becomes (67-74). This provides the lender with the pledge item and a minimal handout to the person in need. One trick that I have learned during my years in the business is to know when to sell the pledged items to ensure the biggest return. There are times of the year when the stock in gold or precious metals rises driving the price of the item up as well. Most of the people will sell pithy items though which are not worth much, yet some of the materials can be melted down and with a lot more if sold individually.</p> <p>The secret to moneylending is to me stingy with your money, you never know when someone will try to jib you. The nice part is that your job is to do just that to them. Although it may be a dangerous job, dealing with criminals and lowlifes all the time, the return value of them combined makes for a very shiny profit (5).

Here the founders, Sonya and Lizaveta, meet every Sunday morning starting at 10 o&rsquo;clock and discuss the different interpretations of God&rsquo;s words. Their bible group, which is still unnamed, strives to preserve the communal values the church seems to have abandoned. Sonya and Lizaveta welcome any new member regardless of social or economic standing. There are no fees, no tithings; the only a strong faith in God. Below, is a sample of Sonya and Lizaveta&rsquo;s response to Luke 6:20.</p> <b>Luke 6:20 Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. <center>GOD FORGIVES ALL</center></b> <center><i>response by Sonya Marmeladov</i></center> <p>This is a message we can all learn from . . . especially my fellow residents of St.Petersburg. It&rsquo;s quite common to meet someone impoverished on the streets these days, and who knows, the next person you greet may very well be such a man or woman. I am one of these folks that people consider &ldquo;impoverished&rdquo;, but in my own right, with the help of faith, and in God&rsquo;s eyes, I am very rich, despite the . . . adverse circumstances that may surround my family and I. Faith in God and hope for the future has allowed me to realize that life is more than just the physical and tangible manifestations of prosperity, extending beyond wealth, social status, and perhaps even health. With faith, we can learn to overcome the convoluted principal of ranking within our society.</p> <p>Many times I have quite seriously thought of ending all my suffering and eradicating my sins (272). But then I remembered that if I can do anything to better myself, that is to hope and to pray to the Lord and remember my duties. My family, my stepmother, my little brothers and sisters, they are all dependent of me, and even more so now since our father has recently left us. I pray that the Lord forgives him. If it weren&rsquo;t for my faith . . . well . . . What should I do without God? He does everything (274). If it were not for God, why I would hope that I could not go on another day. If it were not for God, I do not think living would be worth the costs. If it were not for God, who would forgive me for what <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> done?</p> <p>I had went to church last week for my friend, Lizaveta&rsquo;s requiem to be sung. She was murdered with an axe (275). To my surprise, and of great shock to me, I discovered that the killer is a man who had done very charitable deeds for my family in the past four days, and who truly must have a pure heart to protect his dear sister from a man full of corruption and vanity, whom I must believe God has also defended me from. Yes, when Andrey Semenovich came to defend me from the scandals of Peter Petrovich, Katerina Ivanovna my stepmother exclaimed, &ldquo;God sent you to her!&rdquo; And even more shocking, the man who killed my dear friend Lizaveta was also one to defend me at that time! But now he is a man that God has saved as well. Yes, he revealed himself as the killer to me, and I forgave him, because God forgives even the greatest of our sins, and I am not above God, and neither could he be. I simply helped him come to realize this important fact of our lives, and carried him from the arms of the devil to ask forgiveness from the Lord once again (351).</p> <p>But none of that is important now. All that is important is knowing God and loving and serving him, so he may forgive you for the sins you have committed under him. Choose to be a part of your brothers and sisters under God, and always remember to try to do what is right. God will always forgive you when you are wrong. </p> <center><i>response by Lizaveta Ivanovna</i></center> <p>As I read over Luke 6:20, I can&rsquo;t help but smile. This passage opens my eyes and reminds me that my time spent suffering represents only a sliver of myself. I live with my step-sister Alena Ivanovna, a local pawnbroker who is known for having...an aggressive and profitable business. Her trade has fetched her over five thousand roubles (54), giving her the luxury of living comfortably . Yet, Alena keeps the roubles for herself and I admit, I dream of the roubles lingering near my fingertips. The coins tempt me- teasing and torturing me with the image of a better life out of Alena&rsquo;s control.</p> <p>Yet, I&#39;m content with my life. I&#39;m content with working day in and day out, only to hand over my income to Alena, and I&#39;m content knowing that she has left me out of her will (55). Although my life seems difficult and demanding, Luke 6:20 reminds me that my discomfort is only temporary; giving me hope that God has a better life waiting for me. As I work, my copper cross (442) hangs heavily from my neck everyday, a permanent reminder that God is always watching and protecting. With this comforting fact, I find solace that He knows my path, even if i&#39;m oblivious to His signs. While I may be poor and weeping now, I will soon become rich and be laughing in the Kingdom of God.</p> <p>Sonya and Lizaveta clearly have a strong faith in God, a faith that they wish to share with others. The church&rsquo;s greed and abuse of power proves the genuinely faithful will seek God, even if their socioeconomic stature holds them back. With less trust in the church, smaller religious groups can finally present another opinion on the Bible, perhaps catalyzing the second Protestant Reformation? Ironically, God&rsquo;s view on money is clear in Mark 12:41-44, &ldquo; Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins...They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything- all she had to live on&rdquo;. God doesn&#39;t want the representations of wealth, God only asks for faith, something we need more of in St. Petersburg.</p>',

	body: '<p>Dear Anastasia,</p> <p>My brother is going through terrible times right now and I am trying to support him by working as a maid for a family in my town. I am a respectful maid and have done everything that the lady of the house wishes, such as picking up after the children, doing chores, and maintaining a suitable household for my employers. But, one day as I was clearing the breakfast table, the master of the house started making &ldquo;sarcastic and discourteous remarks&rdquo; about by cleaning skills (26). Of course I cannot say anything because I am his employee, but I do not deserve to be treated this way, especially since I am there best maid and I have not given him any motive to accuse me of improper maid habits. His wife and children, however, speak to me &ldquo;kindly and generously&rdquo; and always advise me to disregard the comments that the master says (26). But, this is only helpful when the master is not impaired by &ldquo;Bucchus&rdquo; because he is especially cruel with his humor and nasty jokes (26).</p> <p>But this was not even the worst part! One day while I was walking through the garden on their estate, he pulled me aside and professed his mad infatuation for me! He ardently apologized for acting rudely towards me and &ldquo;simply wanted to hide the true state of affairs from other people&rdquo; (26). He even declared that he would leave his wife and we could run away to another estate or abroad. This all was quite absurd because I respect his wife and I definitely did not want to cause a scandal. I told him that I did not reciprocate his feelings and that I could not possibly leave my family! My brother depends on me and I cannot possibly leave my debt and my mother.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the master&rsquo;s wife heard what he had professed to me. She called me many horrible names and struck me. This denouncement lasted a whole hour and I was not able to defend myself because I did not want to cause any more scandal in the family, even if I was not the instigator. She eventually threw me out of the house and ordered me to return to my mother without pay. To make matters worse, and for her to feel better, she arranged for me to ride in a peasant&rsquo;s cart. She threw all of my clothes in a cart unpacked and strewn all over. Once I was in that cart, it started raining.</p> <p>Anastasia, I need your advice. I am &ldquo;insulted and humiliated&rdquo; and I do not know what to do (27). How am I going to find work with this scandal on my resume? Please advise me.</p> <p>Best regards, <br /> Troubled Sister</p> <br /><p>Dear Troubled Sister,</p> <p>I am deeply anguished by your situation. One does not deserve that treatment, especially since you were not encouraging the master of your house. First of all, I respect that you work in order to make money for your brother to become educated, but you are not responsible for him. Allow him to work for the money himself. He is a man, he should not depend on his sister to support him. If he is truly an astounding student, he should be able to get scholarships or seek assistance from other benefactors. If you do this, the burden of supporting your brother is released.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the lady of the house reacted in such a way. But, I am surprised that she would denounce you publically because it exposes her husband unfaithfulness as well. If that were me, I would have not exposed him publically because I feel as though that makes me seem like an unsatisfactory wife and that my husband has to stray away to satisfy his wants and desires. But, her actions are inexcusable and seem to some as cruel. I am sure that to people who know you, they understand that you would not commit the actions that she accused you of.</p> <p>If you are looking for a job though, I would try to search in other towns that do not know your prior employer. I recommend not divulging information regarding your loss of prior job as a maid. Troubled Sister, you may even want to search for another profession. You can be a shopkeeper or work in a clothing boutique. Employers of those shops normally do not ask why you were let go from prior jobs.</p> <p>Hopefully I have advised you in a useful way and you have some direction of what you should do. Please allow your brother to take care of himself and you do the same for yourself.</p> <p>Best Wishes, <br /> Anastasia</p>',

This question is focused on the choices Dunya makes in regards to Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin in Part One, Chapter III and whether the mother must intervene.</p>',
	body: '<p>Dear Anastasia,</p> <p>I am worried for the sake of my daughter. Recently my daughter was in the public eye due to a scandal she was caught up within. No one in the village would talk or surround himself or herself with us and the whole town talked about the scandal for weeks (27). Luckily the woman who had accused my daughter of having an affair was &ldquo;thunder-struck&rdquo; and overwhelmed, as she herself confessed to me and my daughter that she was wrong in her accusations; it was all a misunderstanding. &ldquo;She was, however, fully convinced of my dear child&rsquo;s innocence, and the very next day, Sunday, she went straight to the cathedral and on her knees prayed with tears to Our Lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and perform her duty&rdquo;(28). Our family does not come from much wealth but a &ldquo;suitor has presented himself&rdquo;(29). He is not a savory character and there seems &ldquo;to be something lacking in him&rdquo;(29) but he has wealth and stability that will support our family. Since her scandal, I am worried that she is settling because of this man&rsquo;s wealth and I feel it is too soon after to immediately fall into a marriage. I was carful to tell my son only good things about the man, Luzhin, and I think over time I have convinced myself of his worth. Of course my question to you is should I celebrate the union because of the stability it will bring to my family or am I fooling myself of his merits and am I in any position to stop this wedding?</p> <p>Always your reader,<br /> Apprehensive Mother</p> <br /> <p>Dear Apprehensive Mother,</p> <p>You may be surprised to hear this, but your issue is not unique to yourself. I have many a time told families the same advice I will tell you now. Often I hear about wealthy men going to poor Russian communities to find wives because they want to be seen as the &ldquo;savior&rdquo; or &ldquo;caretaker&rdquo; of the family. Most of the time families in your position are very bad off and must accept the proposal in order to survive, however in your case you seem to have room to decline the offer. I say, find out your daughter&rsquo;s feelings, ask her opinion and if she feels the same way as you forget this suitor. She may feel like there is no other option, but if you feel the family can survive and is not dependent on this marriage be sure to make that understood. If she is made aware of the real financial standings she may not feel as pressured to settle for a man your family does not approve of. Make sure to reassure her that there will be another man to come around that will catch her eye; St. Petersburg is a large city. As far as the scandal goes, make sure her name is cleared and distance yourselves from the cause of the scandal. Do not be so worried. At this time, all you can do is support you daughter&rsquo;s choices and desires. If she wants to marry this &ldquo;unsavory character&rdquo; let her do it as long as it is what she wants to do and not what she is feeling pressured to do. You should feel honored to have a proposal for your daughter; she now has the option of being taken care of.</p> <p>I wish the very best for you and your family, and I hope you find comfort in knowing you are not alone.</p> <p>Sincerely,<br /> Anastasia</p>',

She is well known in town as the pawnbroker, rumored to be very wealthy although living in an area of poverty.</p> <p>She is not survived by any known family members as her sister died as well that night. She will be deeply missed by friends as well as her customers. A service will be held four days after the death.</p> <p><b>Autopsy Report</b>: There were many cuts in the cranium as well as bruises on the knees and cuts on the arms. These injuries lead to the conclusion of murder, the weapon of choice, an axe. The cuts on the head were harsh yet not clean, as if the &quot;blunt side of the axe&quot; (66) was used. Her arms were cut, most likely because they were used to try and shield herself (66). In her hands she held the pledge of a customer, name not disclosed. This seems like the most probable suspect and the police are in the process of examining evidence.</p> <h3>Ivanovna, Lizaveta</h3> <p>Lizaveta died alongside her sister in their shared apartment in the southwestern end of St. Petersburg (469). She was known as the kind and beautiful, younger sister of the pawnbroker.</p> <p>She is not survived by any known family but her close friends will forever remember her youthful soul. A service for both her and her sister will be held four days after their death. </p> <p><b>Autopsy Report</b>: There was one direct hit on the top of her head. &quot;The blow fell on her skull, splitting it open from the top of the forehead almost to the crown of the head, and felling her instantly&quot; (68). It is assumed that the same weapon was used on both Ivanovna sisters. Lizaveta was found holding a package so it is speculated that Lizaveta walked in after an errand to the Haymarket two minutes before she herself was bludgeoned to death (53).</p> <h3>Marmeladov, Semyon Zakharovich</h3> <img style="float:right;width:15%;" src="img/semyon.jpg" /> <p>Semyon died in the comfort of his home surrounded by his family; his loving wife Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladov, his daughter Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov, his three other children, his good friend Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov and a the doctor Zossimov.

His chest &quot;was all crushed, trampled and lacerated; several ribs on the right side were broken&quot; (156). There was also a large &quot;yellowish-black&quot; bruise immediately over the heart left by a stomping hoof of a horse. He had been run over by the wheels of a carriage. Is it unclear whether it was a drunken accident or a purposeful attempt at suicide. There was a high amount of substances commonly found in vodka in his blood stream. The police explanation was that &quot;the unfortunate man had been caught by a wheel and dragged along the roadway for some thirty yards&quot; (156). A friend, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, found him in the street near his St. Petersburg home. He had been run over by the wheels of a carriage. </p> <h3>Marmeladov, Katerina Ivanovna</h3> <img style="float:left;width:12%;margin:10px;" src="img/katerina.jpg" /> <p>Katerina died in her home after suffering from a long time illness.

A funeral will be held and close friends will be contacted for the specifics. </p> <p><b>Autopsy Report</b>: Katerina Ivanovna suffered from a terminal illness Tuberculosis of which the symptoms included coughing up blood, hallucinations, and delirium (358). She sand and danced in the street and cried for the sake of her children; she did not want them to become orphans (357). Her face was bloodless and yellow when she passed (367); she choked on her own blood causing death.</p>',
