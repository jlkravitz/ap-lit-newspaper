	author: 'Joshua Kravitz',
	character: 'Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov',
	inspiration: 'My inspiration for this article came from my interest in the philosophy of Nietzche&rsquo;s &ldquo;superman.&rdquo; As we know from the Epilogue of the novel, Raskolnikov is in a Siberian prison. I thought it would be an interesting twist to have Raskolnikov writing this article from this prison. The article allowed me to explore Raskolnikov&rsquo;s personality, but, at the same time, it allowed me to change certain aspects of his character which evolved over the years since the murder.',
	body: '<p>I remember it like yesterday. I had motive; I had a weapon (it may have only been an axe, but it got the job done); and I had a plan. I killed the pawnbroker. Blood splattered everywhere, leaving a physical and mental stain that would surround me for the rest of my life&#8230;</p> <p>I just remembered the article I wrote six months before the murder I committed. I believe it was entitled &ldquo;Concerning Crime.&rdquo; I felt a deep connection with these ideas. I thought I was the &uuml;bermensch, the superman, the extraordinary man with a power to remove the obstacles that stood in my way, to follow my own moral codes. As determined as I seemed to Porfiry about the theories in my article (218), I realize now that I was wholly wrong. What I thought were my own morals were really baselessness, ignorance, helplessness. It may seem to the reader a harsh charge, but nonetheless, I feel it is true.</p> <p>Porfiry &ndash; I remember it quite well &ndash; was trying to get a confession out of me as he elaborated on the ideas in my article: &ldquo;&#8230;there are persons who are able, or rather, not who are able but who have every right, to commit any wrong or crime, and that laws, so to say, are not made for them&rdquo; (219). I believed this to be true, no doubt&#8230;Sure, there are those who can ignore all laws. But, realistically, not everyone can be like this. This person must be the right person. There cannot be so many superman &ldquo;gods,&rdquo; as Nietzsche put it. Back then, I was no extraordinary man&#8230;but&#8230;today&#8230;today is different.</p> <p>Prison has changed me. That day I thought I was killing a principle (233)&#8230;I was&#8230;it was&#8230; I killed a person&#8230;a living, breathing person&#8230;and I do regret it. I regret it as a &ldquo;simple blunder,&rdquo; though I have no guilt for what I did (458). What I did was no sin, but just an error on my part. Now I am in this Siberian prison, &ldquo;on the bank of a wide remote river&rdquo; (451). As I sit in this jailed cell, toilet crouched in a cramped corner, half-size bed laid across the ground next to the sink, and measly sums of unattractive food, I have had plenty of time to think. It is not the fact that I killed a person that bothers me&#8230;it is the fact that I killed this person believing I was the &uuml;bermensch. If I were this &ldquo;superman,&rdquo; it would have been acceptable...But I wasn&rsquo;t, so it is not. Say I were to commit the murder now &ndash; then, it may have been OK&#8230;my mind might not be warped and fixated on my crime. I, a mighty god! Think of it!</p> <p>Every Saturday, the guards let us go the library for one hour. We can read to our hearts content for that one hour, then our time is up. As I meander around the worn-down book shelves, I am attracted to the philosophy section. Nietzsche and I have strikingly similar ideas, but one thing I confidently disagree with. He says the &uuml;bermensch is just an ideal, something we can think about, but not actually see. I believe this not to be true&#8230;Frankly, I am evidence of this untruth! Razumikhin, I remember, was scared for me &ndash; scared that the detectives would think I committed a crime he thought I didn&rsquo;t: &ldquo;You have nothing to do with it, so be hanged to them! We shall have the laugh of them afterwards&rdquo; (249-250). He was horrified at my ideas hidden within &ldquo;Concerning Crime.&rdquo; I am sure he had little idea of what was going on in my head (as did I), but now my head is clear. I know who I am and what I want to do. I feel an obligation to murder those who worsen society, an obligation that I cannot control. Who shall die first I do not know, but it shall be done, one by one.</p> <p>Luzhin? He angers me&#8230;I never liked him. Why he would go for Dunya I do now know&#8230;and I most likely never shall. He&rsquo;s rich and only wanted to &ldquo;help&rdquo; our family, as he put it. Oh, and Svidrigaylov? Thankfully, he&rsquo;s dead. Porfiry? He was always suspicious of me, implementing creative strategies to get my confession (377). He is a smart man, that man&#8230;He may not have forced my confession, but he no doubt expedited the process.</p> <p>Only 7 more years&#8230;until I can exercise my moral codes... &ldquo;We shall see, we shall see&#8230;&rdquo; (377).</p>',

	title: 'The Fluidity of Friendship and Family: an Investigation of the Definition and Importance of Social Constructs',
	author: 'Ryan Lin',
	character: 'Dmitri Razumikhin',
	inspiration: 'Friendship and family plays a vital role in the success of Rodion. This paper aims to illustrate the purpose of such social constructs through the eyes of Razumikhin.',
	body: '<p>Throughout the history of the mankind, all persons have gone with some sort of care from friends and family. For most people, their parents took care of them; mothers and fathers nurture their children until adulthood, and after which the cycle continues with a new progeny. This unwavering cycle of life and death brings about a myriad of questions answered in the study of social constructionism. Do animals form social bonds? Yes. However, this question misses the fundamental goal of social constructionism: what roles do these social interactions play in the everyday lives of people and what effect does it have on society?</p> <p> In order to fully understand the concept of social constructionism, we must first look toward a formal definition for &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;family.&rdquo; What exactly do these words mean and how do they define being? For humans, a family is a group of persons related through blood, marriage, or house. Examining the relationship of house further, we find that friends may be considered family; a family that an individual chooses to become close with and develop personal bonds. In this respect, it is easy to then question what exactly constitutes a friend. A friend may be defined as someone a person enjoys being with; however, this would raise the question of whether the person must reciprocate such feelings. On a personal level, the clear answer is yes-it matters a great deal to an individual what the other thinks: the human condition inherently calls for a curiosity of the other. Thus we may conclude that a friend has two prerequisites: 1) a person that an individual enjoys being with and 2) reciprocate feelings, or in other words, a mutual affection between two people. </p> <p> All humans have a basic need for some family or caregiver in the beginning years of life. A baby does not emerge from the womb fully clothed and ready to take on the dangers of the earth, rather, it appears crying and defenseless, unsettled from its previously comfortable abode. However, mankind would appear to require family past the developmental stages of life. Family plays an integral role in the development of identity. Additionally, they often provide emotional growth for the individual; the family creates a base plate for the living soul (216-217) to spring from. It invigorates the mind and the body in order to help create and foster a new human experience. Family helps to define what people believe to be real and what they believe to be right: the role of family helps solidify moral values. </p> <p> Returning to the definition of friendship, what role would such a being have in the grand scheme of society? Unlike familial bonds, friendships are created and forged through time; family is handed to each and every individual whereas friends must be sought and fought for. Personal habits are undoubtedly affected by friends: socialization subconsciously implants thoughts and beliefs within the minds of people. Furthermore, the responsibilities to a friend often subjugate other desires, be it caring for a friend (166-173) versus a party, or want of riches versus maintaining a friendship. The actions taken by an individual to these choices embody the morals and values taught to them through his or her fraternization with friends and family. Consequently, social order has basic ties to the beliefs of groups of peoples: families of people. Inherent bonds to society exist in the realm of friendship; society is made of an amalgamation of people, all of whom are guaranteed to have a friend. Transitively, a society can be thought of as a large chain of friends and families that unite to form a network of individuals. These individual relationships run the world: social interaction keeps humanity moving forward.</p> <p> Ultimately, friendships and families are inextricably linked. A family of friends may constitute one&rsquo;s second family, or their only family in the case of a broken home. When considering the wide reaching implications of social constructs, we must take time to investigate their purpose and definition. To this end, the normative behaviors of society are created from the basics of humanity: the interpersonal relationships formed from friendships and family. Though some may argue of how social relationships come about, they undeniably affect society through the collective actions of characters.</p>',

	title: 'Concerning Crime',
	author: 'Ryan Lin',
	character: 'Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov',
	inspiration: 'Throughout the course of&rdquo;Crime and Punishment&rdquo;, Rodion often utilizes his paper to justify his killing of Lizaveta and Alyona. This paper attempts to recreate the ubermensch-esque style of justification along with a critical analysis behind the reason for crime.',
	body: '<p>Discount the idea that equality leads to a better world. It doesn&rsquo;t. People have and always will face different challenges in their separate, immeasurable, indigent lives. These challenges build the human race. Over the course of human history, crime has always prevailed as a never ending onslaught of broken moral code. Everyone has the capacity to commit crime. This paper investigates the root cause of crime; how, in committing crime, some men surpass the human condition, transcending into a different plane of existence, while others may simply harm themselves and others.</p> <p> A criminal must have no regard for the universality of moral law. In effect, crime transgresses the boundaries that humanity places upon its people. Crime harms everyone. Crime destroys fundamental beliefs. Society itself does not truly know what it means to commit a crime. It does know, however, that crime harms morality and oftentimes undermines the law. In effect, one can conclude that a criminal has no need for society.</p> <p> Psychologically speaking, how &ldquo;well&rdquo; is a criminal? Before the act, the perpetrator of crime might contemplate, plan the act months or weeks in advance. His psyche takes a toll. He continuously wonders how he will ever succeed in the face of the law. He might doubt himself (1-2). The ceaseless self-doubt gouges into the mind of the criminal, rendering him unresponsive to moral thought. Only the gravity of his actions matter in his mind. The criminal ponders the ramifications of his actions, thinking that he might lose everything and gain nothing, finally concluding that he will not follow through. But, in the end, he does do it. The door opens, the axe falls, and the victim dies (64-68). </p> <p> The fruition of crime engenders two distinct possibilities. On one hand, the criminal kills for the sake of killing, not for personal gain, but for the greater good. The other case uncovers a simple utilitarian exercise. In the latter case, the criminal may continue to commit crime after crime simply to gain more capital. This inevitably leads to societal harms, with laws broken every which way with no gain to society whatsoever. In essence, this crime is unjust. Moreover, crime, a psychologically taxing event, cleaves through the criminal&rsquo;s mind, leaving him a spineless, immoral being: &ldquo;the act of committing a crime is always accompanied by some morbid condition,&rdquo; (219). The psyche of an ordinary man will invariably be damaged in the commission of crime. Undoubtedly, crime committed in this manner should never reach realization. This then begets the secondary problem.</p> <p> Is crime ever justified? When a man kills for the benefit of society, does he himself surpass humanity? People are inherently unequal. Egalitarianism, conversely, deems this notion untrue. To this end, there are several assumptions that one must accept as true in order to justify &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; (225) murder. Return to my opening statement. Equality does not necessarily lead to a better life. Moreover, one must assume that morality and law has no meaning without personal meaning, and consequently, an &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; man would not &ldquo;suffer if he is conscious of error&rdquo; (224). The murders and crimes an &Uuml;bermensch commits would then be deemed by one above moral law to benefit society in some way, for example, the loss of a wretched old lady may benefit the poor masses. A lapse of moral judgment never would inflict such a theoretical superman. He is without fault. Conscious suffering and psychological harm do not come upon our &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; criminal because he fashions his own morality. He remains pure and untouched.</p> <p> Society and the government may not be accepting of the notion of justified crime. However, as with all progress, the key remains an open mind. Isaac Newton. Galileo Galilei. Their breakthroughs met heavy resistance but ultimately proved true. With the modern world changing so quickly, this paper postulates a novel idea for the betterment of humanity as a whole. I hypothesize the idea that the psychological impact of crime inflicts two different classes of man differently. Egalitarianism is wrong. A principle that all of humanity remains equal remains a revolting notion that spits in the face of individual development. Crime can be justified.</p>',

	title: 'Like A Moth Circling a Candle to Its Death',
	author: 'Sidonie Kilpatrick',
	character: 'Pofiry Petrovich',
	inspiration: 'Porify Petrovich is a hunter in the field of investigations. This detective has uncovered many murderers and thieves based on his intuition and methods for uncovering a murderer. Here he explains his philosophy for discovering a guilty suspect.',
	body: '<p>&ldquo;...Every case, every crime, for example, as soon as it really occurs, at once becomes a quite special case, and sometimes it is absolutely unlike anything that has ever happened before&rdquo; (287). I have been a detective for many years. I see what most do not see: the facial expressions, the tone in an innocent man&rsquo;s voice, and especially the tone in a guilty man&rsquo;s voice. Ever since childhood I have excelled and enjoyed pastimes that involved the alluring game of cat and mouse. As a teenager, I learned to identify people who committed minor crimes, such as stealing. I also read profusely about the perfect crime to harness and fine-tune my skills. This ultimately paved the way to my future career that is my passion and my life.</p> <p>My profession is based on evidence. If I do not have support to substantiate my belief, I cannot convict a man of his crimes. I am &ldquo;fallible like everybody else, I confess...I want to have evidence that is like two and two make four! I want something like direct and incontrovertible proof! (286). By arresting a suspect prematurely, I feel as though this is the worse thing a detective can do because they give the man piece of mind and allow himself to not be on his toes constantly, which would consequently cause him implicate himself.</p> <p>Interrogations are very important because I lead the suspect to believe that I know what they have done, but instantly calm their nerves by convincing them that I see them &ldquo;as a visitor&rdquo; (284). These tactics seem polar opposites because they switch from hot to cold, but they fluster the suspect and feel as though they have &ldquo;fallen into a trap&rdquo; (283). I believe that &ldquo;a legal method, applying to all sorts of investigations, by which they begin with trivial matters, far removed from the real subject, or even with something serious, so long as it is quite irrelevant, so as to encourage the person being interrogated, or rather to distract his attention and lull his mistrust, and then suddenly stun him by hitting him on the crown of his head with the most dangerous and fatal question&rdquo; (282-283). It is quite comical during my interrogations because I &ldquo;gesticulate ceaselessly&rdquo; and pace back and forth asking questions. For suspects that believe that they are superior to you, take this as your advantage. They will not suspect where the line of questioning is going when talking to a babbling detective and will assume that you are incapable of discovering their secret. They will soon become agitated because you will not give them a moment to think, let alone think about where you are heading in the interrogation. At this exact moment, you address exactly why they are here and ask them a specific question that either implicates them or produces a hole in their allaby.</p> <p>The poison that causes men to confess is guilt. It strips away their patients and eats away at their conscience. This affects the felonious so much so that they are like moths circling &ldquo;around me as if I were a candle: freedom will no longer be a boon to him; he will begin to brood, he will get himself into a muddle, entangle his own feet in a net, and worry himself to death!...He&rsquo;ll keep circling round me, closer and closer, and then plop! He&rsquo;ll fly straight into my mouth, and I&rsquo;ll swallow him, and that will be satisfactory&rdquo; (287-288). They cannot escape this fate. They will either confess or go mad. I even influence this during my interrogations because I make the suspect feel that I am taunting them, which ultimately enrages him, and I act afraid as though they are going crazy and they are over sensitive. This causes the suspect to become nervous because they will think that I deem them guilt, but in actuality, I have already thought that since they walked into my office.</p> <p>An interrogation is &ldquo;an art, in its own way&rdquo; (284). They take constant practice and force you to think past the normal constraints of asking simple questions that have obvious answers. They are also very satisfying once you close a case and ensure justice to a grieving family.</p>',

	title: 'Becoming the Perfect Man, Becoming Peter Petrovich',
	author: 'Michael Wu',
	character: 'Peter Petrovich',
	inspiration: 'Without a doubt, Peter Petrovich is selfish and arrogant. His actions, seemingly charitable and generous, always benefits himself before others. However, Peter is rich, influential, and confident; exuding his confidence through his clothing and appearance.',
	body: '<p>As a prestigious lawyer, ranking as a Civil Councillor (29), a position of high political and social standing, I know everything a man should know about confidence, something most of you simple don&rsquo;t possess. During my daily carriage journey to my newly renovated office, I&rsquo;m tormented by the sight of countless men in tattered clothes. From my decades of experience in the law industry, an industry that demands self-assurance, I can conclude that confidence begins externally and works its way within. When a stranger, an employer, or a woman first lays eyes on you, what does he or she see? From a distance, their first impression is how you dress. Sub-consciously, they judge you, making assumptions about your reliability, dedication and your integrity. Thus, the first step toward achieving assurance similar to my own is through your appearance, your first impression.</p> <p>If you model yourself after me, you&rsquo;ve already made a great first impression without even saying a word. First, All clothing must be new and clean. Even if a jacket fits like a hand-made glove, a threadbare or out of style jacket will only hinder your appearance. Dispose of that insult of a jacket. Tailor your jackets, shirts, and trousers to conform and complement your body. A tailor can work wonders; drawing attention to the shoulders while narrowing the waist. Of course, my personal clothes require minimal to no alterations. Next are the essentials every respectable, confident man needs in their wardrobe. The three things every man needs are a hat, a watch, and a pair of gloves. Due to my financial stability, I prize my elegant, handmade round hat, my soft, French calfskin gloves (124) and my solid gold hunter (122). Combined, these accompaniments add a flourish while demonstrating a superior sense of sophistication and wealth. Having fitted clothes along with a few accompaniments apply year round while casting the foundation for a tasteful wardrobe.</p> <p>While some advice applies all year, there are seasonal changes. In the majestic St. Petersburg summers, I wear brighter, more vivid colors to align with summer&rsquo;s cheerful tone. For a typical day, I wear a light-brown summer jacket, brightly colored trousers and waistcoat, and solid shirt with contrasting stripe (124). With bright colors, I appear youthful, lively and energetic. </p> <p>Now that I have provided clothing advice, I shift to another important aspect: personal grooming. One of the best benefits of a fresh and handsome face (124) is that it disguises my true age. Hair is another tool to emulate youth while adding a personal flourish. Finding the right haircut takes time and trials. In my experience, mutton-chops complement my cheeks while curled hair (124) complements my face. I advise finding your own suitable style. However, clean, healthy skin is essential to completing a youthful face. </p> <p>Tasteful clothing and an organized appearance only get you past a person&rsquo;s first glance. What do you now that you will have a conversation? A conversation is unscripted and demands you to adapt. Fortunately, as a Civil Councillor and esteemed lawyer, I have copious practice responding to what others say. That being said, I do have some wisdom that applies to most conversations Now you smile, look into their eyes, and talk about what you know best, yourself. I integrate and weave the pompous and varied vocabulary only a university education can provide into everything I utter. Instead of saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;, Say &ldquo;I regret, with complete and absolute sincerity, that I find you in this state.&rdquo; ( 124) Not only do you exercise a lexicon superior to the average St. Petersburg man, thereby asserting to the other party of your superior education, you also illustrate your emotions, revealing your compassionate characteristics as well. I also disclose my accomplishments during casual conversation to bolster my superior stature. For instance, I feature my recent &ldquo;important case in the Senate&rdquo; (124) while illustrating the parties and galas I attend due to my rank as a Civil Councillor (29). In conjunction with my refined fashion sense, I allow others to deduce that I&rsquo;m the quintessential man: a winning combination of physical and intellectual countenance.</p> <p>To most men, confidence eludes their grasp. I consider myself fortunate that I deduced the magical formula to achieve total self-assurance. Early in my career, I realized that people are quick to judge others and turned that knowledge to my advantage. A sharp suit and a few elegant words are a man&rsquo;s best friend. So before you set out on your next important meeting, remember my advice. Remember what it takes to make a man.</p>',

	body: '<p>You ask of honour? Does someone of my . . . explicit profession have the capability to acquire such a thing so . . . highly regarded and even worshipped as if divine? This is not a simple question of choice within our corrupt society, no. It is a question of duty . . . and of worthiness within . . . your own eyes. One&rsquo;s honour cannot be measured by another&rsquo;s observations of his or her actions, but only by one&rsquo;s own motives and one&rsquo;s own ability to fulfill his or her own self by duty and by execution. My yellow card is the mark of my duty for me, not a symbol of shame in my own eyes.</p> <p>My stepmother yelled as the little ones cried, &ldquo;What is there to preserve so carefully? What a treasure!&rdquo; (14) Yes, Katerina Ivanovna was right. Yes, I was . . . forced into what I do today to earn my capital, but I forgive my father and stepmother. I have naught to give to anyone except for myself, and there is much to be gained from the sacrifice of my superficial &ldquo;honour&rdquo;. I hold the right to fulfill my obligations to myself and to my family as I see fit within reason, as any other man or woman is! Every day my family, my siblings, they suffered! Fear and starvation gripped them as I suffered alongside them. There is nothing I can hope for more than the welfare of the little ones at my home, and I do what I can to help them, and I fulfill my own duties to them, with God&rsquo;s help. The first night of my activities, I brought thirty roubles home and laid them on the table in silence, and my stepmother and I cried ourselves to sleep. Yes what a treasure I am now. I am all my family has to hope for now, how can I be ashamed of that!</p> <p>I suffered for nothing before then, doomed to a fate that I could not possibly control. Now, I suffer, and I am paid . . . given what I need in return for others wishes. And I forgive my clients, it is a natural desire, however &ldquo;dishonourable&rdquo; it may be. Yes, god forgives all . . . and I am not higher than God, certainly not. Forgiveness and compassion is only what the Lord asks of you, and of me. I am the holder of a yellow card in my neighborhood of St.Petersburg, not because of my father&rsquo;s inability or my stepmother&rsquo;s wishes. No, I hold my card for my duties, my duties to my siblings, and to myself. I do not expect society to forgive me for my . . . suggestive actions in the recent past. But an even worse fate would be not to forgive myself for simply taking care of my business.</p>',
